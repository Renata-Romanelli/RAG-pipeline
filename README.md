# RAG Pipeline with Unstructured Files

This repository contains a code implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline designed to process unstructured files. A RAG pipeline combines retrieval of relevant information from a dataset with a generative model to provide more accurate and context-aware responses. This approach is particularly valuable when working with complex documents, as it enables the retrieval of specific information before applying generative AI to summarize, answer questions, or provide insights.

In this implementation, the unstructured library is used to handle raw files, including parsing elements like text, titles, and images from unstructured data formats such as PDFs. The pipeline is orchestrated using LangChain, which streamlines each step in the RAG process.

The example included in the code demonstrates the pipeline processing a PDF file containing text, titles, and images, showcasing how the RAG model extracts and generates insights from unstructured content effectively. This setup allows users to work seamlessly with complex document types in a streamlined, automated way.

The PDF used in the example is included in the repository with the title: RAG best prectices
